# GameShelfAPI
GameShelfAPI is a microservice-based project that provides information and recommendations for board games. It consists of multiple Flask-based services handling user preferences, game information, and personalized recommendations. Initially designed for local deployment, GameShelfAPI is built to scale with future cloud integration on Microsoft Azure.
